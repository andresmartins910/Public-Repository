  <p id="quote">"When you give in to aversion and anger, itâ€™s as though, having decided to kill someone by throwing him into a river, you wrap your arms around his neck, jump into the water with him, and you both drown. In destroying your enemy, you destroy yourself as well.""</br>-- H. E. Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche</p>
